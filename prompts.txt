a gas station in the middle of nowhere
an attic
turn-of-the-century Europe
modesty
a city of wonder
a carnival during winter
waking from a dream
the leaves are falling
cool
red
my hunger and my pain
bitterness
monochrome
a landscape lost in mist
familial feelings
the ruined parts of a city
the moonlight
cruel words
by the river
magical characters or creatures
the ocean
a shadowy forest
indifference
a road trip
a love affair
schadenfreude
